# Online-Foosball
Django based online Foosball Game

Foosball is fun, and we want to bring it online to everyone! So we built an online foosball game platform, where users can register and login, invite friends to play and compete, and most importantly, have fun. The game interface is fancy and vivid. It has a great sound effect and quite low latency. It would definitely bring you great joy.

features:
1. Developed the backend of Online Foosball Platform in Django platform, featured with user verification, game room creation and friend invitation
2. Implemented an interactive game interface with Javascript, and used Ajax technique for real-time information refresh and updates, such as refresh the game rooms in the games lobby, and the ranks in the leader board.
3. Used Django Channel based WebSocket for real-time information communication and synchronization during the foosball game, which gave a nearly instant multi-user-interactive game experience.
